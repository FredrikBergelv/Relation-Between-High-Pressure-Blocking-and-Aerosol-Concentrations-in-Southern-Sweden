# Analysis of PM₂.₅ Concentration During High-Pressure Blocking Events

This repository contains all scripts and data for my Bachelor's thesis in physics, which has now been turned into an article. The work investigates the relationship between PM₂.₅ concentrations and high-pressure blocking events using data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and air quality measurements from both urban and rural sites in Skåne County, Sweden.

## Article Introduction

It is common knowledge that the Earth’s increasing temperature has many side effects. One such effect is the increase in the frequency of extreme weather phenomena. One such phenomenon, which lacks extensive research, is high-pressure blocking events. A high-pressure blocking event is an anticyclone that covers an area for a prolonged period of time and often blocks other types of weather, hence the name. This results in clearer weather and more extreme temperatures. However, an anticyclone is also associated with lower air movement and wind, causing the air to remain stagnant. This can lead to the accumulation of aerosols, such as PM₂.₅, in the region.

To investigate the relationship between PM₂.₅ and high-pressure blocking, one must analyze periods of high-pressure blocking and examine the concentration of PM₂.₅ during these periods. The goal of this thesis is to analyze the concentration of PM₂.₅ during periods of high-pressure blocking by reviewing data from the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) and PM₂.₅ data from rural (Vavihill, Svalöv, Skåne County) and urban (Malmö, Skåne County) areas.

## Repository Contents

### Files

### Functionality

- `csv_data.py` reads and loads all `.csv` data files into pandas DataFrames, preparing them for analysis.
- `read_datafiles.py` contains core functions used for calculations, including preprocessing and data transformations.
- `making_all_plots_for_report.py` recreates the figures used in the thesis and can be adapted for other stations or periods.

## Requirements

The following Python packages are required to run the code:

```python
import pandas as pd
